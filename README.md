# birthday_email_sender
This project is a simple script that sends automated birthday emails to your friends and family using Python. It reads from an excel sheet that contains all of your friends’ details and checks if today is their birthday. If so, it sends them an email before making a note in your spreadsheet to say they’ve received their email.
